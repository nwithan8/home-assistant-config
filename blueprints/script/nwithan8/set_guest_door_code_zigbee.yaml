# This script uses ZHA Toolkit (https://github.com/mdeweerd/zha-toolkit) to manage smart door lock codes, and therefore ZHA Toolkit needs to be installed.
# There is no gaurantee that this script will work as expected with your particular ZigBee smart door lock.
# This has been tested against a Kwikset SmartCode 916 (https://www.kwikset.com/products/detail/916-smartcode-traditional-electronic-deadbolt-with-zigbee-technology)

    A script that sets a temporary code for a ZigBee smart door lock (via ZHA Toolkit). 
    This script adds and removes a new code, rather than enabling/disabling an existing code.
