# Notes:
#
# Due to timing, HA won't typically register two separate "off" -> "on" and "on" -> "off" triggers in rapid succession (normal click).
# This could be possible if users were to hold down the button for a bit (or with explicit state changes), but instead, this blueprint only allows programming for "on" events.
